This repo contains two small C++ Win32 projects made during my education.
Project files are for Visual Studio 2010.

BMP_Viewer loads a BMP file and shows it in a window and also allow some simple
operations like flipping horizontally or vertically and inverting color channels.

AVI_Viewer uses 3rd party (SoftLab-NSK) DLL library to allow frame by frame
viewing of a video file.
